# Utility Knives
Knives are NOT weapons. Do not use them as weapons. Using them properly is key to not getting hurt.
## Using a Knife
Using a knife in robotics isn't used that often. Occasionally we will use them to open packages, cut something, but overall not used that often. When using a knife the most important thing to remember is to cut away from your body to avoid getting hurt!
