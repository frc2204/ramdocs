# Calipers
Calipers are precision measuring tools used to determine the dimensions of an object with high accuracy. They consist of two arms or jaws, with one being movable, and a calibrated scale to read the measurement. Calipers are commonly used where precise measurements of length, diameter, and depth are required.

## Using Calipers
### Holding Calipers Properly
While there are many ways of holding and handling calipers, the most common way is to hold the long part behind the display with your thumb on the knob as shown below. By spinning the knob, you can make precise adjustments. Be sure to always treat calipers with care as they are what you use to achieve **precise measurements**.

### Changing the Units
When using calipers, you most commonly have the choice between using inches, or millimeters. Our team, 2204, uses imperial measurements, so you would always want it to be on the inches setting.

### Zeroing In Calipers
Before using calipers, it is a good practice to "Zero" in the calipers to ensure the most accurate readings. To "Zero" in calipers, there is usually a button either on the top or bottom which will reset the display to 0.

### How to Measure using Calipers
#### External Measurements 
To take the measurements of the outside of an object, you would most commonly use the two jaws on the bottom. To get an accurate measurement, you would put your object between these jaws and clamp them together. No need to clamp tightly, just tight enough that it is not slipping.

#### Internal Measurements
To get the measurements of the inside of an object, we would use the jaws most commonly located on the top of calipers. The way that you would achieve an accurate measurement is by opening them and pushing out, not too hard, but again tight enough so that it does not slip.

#### Depth Measurements
To get the depth of something using a caliper, you would use the little "stick" that tends to protrude out the side of calipers to get the depth. You would set the end of the "stick" to the bottom of the depth that you are trying to measure and the bottom of the calipers to the top surface.

### Locking in Measurements
After getting your measurements, and you don't want to forget the measurement, you would turn the knob on the top clockwise to lock it in and counterclockwise to free your calipers back up.

## Different Types of Calipers
## Digital
The most common type of calipers today are digital calipers which tells you digitally on a screen what you have measured.

## Vernier 
Vernier calipers are calipers that tend to have a reading on it similar to a ruler. :straight_ruler:  You would need to know how to read these if you didn't have a digital caliper for some reason.
