# Sockets
Sockets, often referred to as socket wrenches or ratchet wrenches, are versatile hand tools used to tighten or loosen fasteners like bolts and nuts. They are an essential part of many toolkits and are commonly used in automotive repairs, construction, maintenance, and other mechanical tasks.

## Using Sockets
Sockets are very similar to screwdrivers, in the fact that you align the head to the "hex" and turn. Sockets are most commonly on the end of a ratchet which allows you to not twist your arm in an award position when moving the (usually) bolt. The clicking sound of the ratchet is very nice :)))
