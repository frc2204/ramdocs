# Files
A file is a tool used to remove material from a piece and is not much different from sandpaper. You could think of files as metal sandpaper!

## Uses for a File
We mainly use files to debur long metal pieces after they have been laser cut. We would also use them to remove splinters from the end of a piece of wood. Files are useful for all sorts of things, but they aren't used as swords!
