# Marking Tools
Marking tools are instruments used to create visible indications on surfaces, objects, or materials for various purposes, such as measurement, identification, or guidance. These tools help ensure accuracy and consistency in tasks that require markings.

## Using Marking Tools
We at FRC use many different types of marking tools which include:
- **Pencils**: Standard graphite pencils are used for marking on paper or wood surfaces due to their easily erasable marks.

- **Markers**: Permanent markers or whiteboard markers are commonly used for labeling, sign-making, or writing on various surfaces.

- **Scribes**: Scribes or scratch awls create fine lines on materials like metal, wood, or leather, often used in woodworking and metalworking.

- **Center Punch**: A center punch is used to create a small indentation as a starting point for drilling or marking on metal surfaces.
