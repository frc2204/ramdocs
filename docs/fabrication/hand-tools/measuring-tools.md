## Using Measuring Tools
In FRC, we use measuring tools everyday no matter what we are doing. Measuring tools are **THE** most important tool that we have in the shop! There are many different kinds, and they do drastically different things.
- **Rulers and Tape Measures**: Rulers are flat tools with marked measurement units used for measuring lengths, while tape measures consist of a retractable tape for longer distances.

- **[Calipers](calipers.md)**: Calipers come in various types (vernier, digital, dial) and are used to measure internal and external dimensions with high accuracy.

- **Measuring Tape**: A specialized tape used for taking measurements in construction, interior design, and various other applications.

- **Protractors**: Protractors measure angles between two lines or surfaces, important in geometry and various technical fields.
