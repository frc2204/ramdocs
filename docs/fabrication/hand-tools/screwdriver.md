# Screwdrivers
Screwdrivers are handheld tools designed for turning screws, bolts, and other fasteners by applying torque. They consist of a handle and a shaft, often with a flat, Phillips, Flathead, Torx, or other types of tips that fit into corresponding screw head designs. Screwdrivers are essential in various tasks. Don't use the back of a screwdriver as a hammer though!
