# Pliers
"Pliers" are hand tools designed for gripping, bending, cutting, and manipulating materials. They consist of two pivoting jaws that can be used to hold objects firmly or to apply force. The jaws can vary in shape and function, with specialized pliers available for tasks such as cutting wires, holding pipes, crimping connectors, and shaping metal.
