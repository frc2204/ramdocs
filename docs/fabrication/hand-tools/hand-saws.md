# Hand Saws
Handsaws are saws you move with your hands. Instead of always using power-tools you can use your hands to saw!

## Uses for hand saws
You would need to use a handsaw when you need to cut a small part off of something, or if you need to make a cut inside. Using a handsaw may be important when the power goes out!
