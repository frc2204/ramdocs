# Tool Chest Rules
1. Put things back where you found them. Non FRC members need to sign in and out tools. The same for non FRC work times. Do not take tools out of 104.
2. When taking and adding new items, let the fabrication lead and shop manager know.
3. Do not use the tools in the tool chest without permission. Get permission from Mrs. Kotlar or a FRC mentor. This is to help prevent accidents and damage to the tools. https://forms.office.com/r/nhtgkw5FZW?origin=lprLink
4. Report any damaged or missing tools to the fabrication lead or shop manager immediately. Or use the qr code.  
5. Keep the tool chest clean and free of debris. Clean up after youâ€™re done.
6. Do not overload the tool chest. Close drawers after getting the tools.
7. Use the tool chest only for its intended purpose. Do not use it as a step stool or the Husky as a workbench.
8. Follow all safety precautions when using tools.
a) Put away tools
b) Sweep floors and tables for screws
c) Lock tool boxes
d) Rearrange tables 
9. If you are unsure about where a tool goes, consult [https://go.rambots.org/inventory](https://go.rambots.org/inventory) (qrcode on bottom)
10. Only use tools that you are trained on. To get training ask the Fabrication Lead/ Shop Manager.
11. Safety glasses should be worn when tools are out.
