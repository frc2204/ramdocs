# Github

GitHub is one of the most popular platforms for software development and version control using git.

Visit GitHub [here](https://github.com/).

!!! info
    GitHub is not the only git hosting service. There are many other services, like [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), and [Gitea](https://gitea.io/en-us/).

## Setup
### Creating an Account
To create an account, go to [github.com](https://github.com/signup) and follow the instructions.

### Joining an Organization
Once you have an account, you can join an organization. Submit your Github username to the programming lead, and you should receive an invite to join the organization in your email. This gives you read and write access to the organization's repositories.

### Student Developer Pack (Optional)
GitHub offers a [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) that gives students access to a bunch of free software and services. This includes free access to GitHub Pro, which allows you to create private repositories.
!!! tip
    The software and access included with GitHub's Student Developer pack is worth well over **$500+ per year**. If your looking for access to software and services, this is a definite must-have.

## Pull Requests
One of the core features of GitHub is pull requests. Pull requests allow you to propose changes to a repository, and then merge those changes into the repository.

As our team uses GitHub, we'll expect you to work on features, and open pull requests to merge those features into the main repository. This allows us to review your code, and make sure that it works before merging it into the main repository.

### Creating a Pull Request

Github offers their own [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) on creating pull requests. We'll go over the basics here.

To create a pull request, you'll need to create a branch, and push that branch to GitHub. For more information on creating branches, see [Git In Action (Multiple Repositories)](git-in-action-multiple).

Once you've pushed your branch to GitHub, you can create a pull request. To do this, go to the repository on GitHub, and click the "Pull Requests" tab. Then, click the "New Pull Request" button.

Github will prompt you to select a base branch and a compare branch. The base branch is the branch that you want to merge your changes into. The compare branch is the branch that you want to merge into the base branch. Typically, the compare branch is the branch that you created.

Once you've selected the base and compare branches, you can click the "Create Pull Request" button. You'll be prompted to enter a title and description for your pull request. Once you've done this, you can click the "Create Pull Request" button again.

Add the programming lead as a reviewer, and click the "Create Pull Request" button again. This will create the pull request, and notify the programming lead.

Congratulations! You've created a pull request! :tada:
