# Github

GitHub is one of the most popular platforms for software development and version control using git.

Visit GitHub [here](https://github.com/).

!!! info
    GitHub is not the only git hosting service. There are many other services, like [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), and [Gitea](https://gitea.io/en-us/).

    For our team, we'll be using GitHub, as it has an excellent balance of features for both beginners and advanced users.

## Setup
### Creating an Account
To create an account, go to [github.com](https://github.com/signup) and follow the instructions.

### Joining an Organization
Once you have an account, you can join an organization. Submit your Github username to the programming lead, and you should receive an invite to join the organization in your email. This gives you read and write access to the organization's repositories.

### Student Developer Pack (Optional)
GitHub offers a [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) that gives students access to a bunch of free software and services. This includes free access to GitHub Pro and even the Jetbrains Suite of IDEs.
!!! tip
    The software and access included with GitHub's Student Developer pack is worth well over **$500+ per year**. If your looking for access to software and services, this is a definite must-have.
