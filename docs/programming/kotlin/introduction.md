# Kotlin Introduction

Kotlin is a programming language that is designed to be concise, safe, and expressive. It is a statically typed language that runs on multiple platforms, including JVM, Android, browsers, and even native. Kotlin is developed by JetBrains, the company behind the JetBrains suite of IDEs, including IntelliJ IDEA, the primary IDE for our team.
