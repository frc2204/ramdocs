# Collections

## Collection & Iterable Interface

*Collection <T>* is the root of the collection hierarchy. The collection interface extends the Iterable interface. The 
`Iterable interface` defines the operations for iterating over elements. For example, elements of an array. Since the 
Collection interface inherits from the Iterable Interface, it also inherited helpful methods that can help us iterate or loop 
over elements. The Collection interface also has its own helpful implementations of methods for its subclasses as well. 
Such as getting the size, checking item membership, checking if two collections are equal, and so on.
