### Introduction to the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC)

The FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) is an exciting program that challenges high school students to design, build, and program robots to compete in a game that changes every year. Founded in 1992, FRC combines the excitement of a varsity sport with the rigor of science and technology, promoting critical thinking, problem-solving, and teamwork.

Each year, FRC releases a new game that requires teams to build a robot that can perform specific tasks. Teams have six weeks to design, build, and program their robot before competing in regional events. The competitions are held in arenas where teams compete head-to-head to complete the game's objectives.

Through participation in FRC, students develop essential life skills such as leadership, communication, and problem-solving, which can benefit them both academically and professionally. FRC provides a unique and exciting opportunity for students to apply their knowledge in a real-world setting and develop valuable skills that will serve them well in the future.

!!! question "How are students selected for leadership positions?"
    After the season ends, all students are given the opportunity to apply for leadership positions. The application process to become apart of core leadership will often require you to submit an written statement of why you are fit for the position. Other leadership positions do not require a written statement, but are encouraged to do so. The current core leadership team will review the applications and select the the new core leadership team.

    Next, the new core leadership team will choose the subteam leads from the previous year's subteam members.


### Subteams

#### Design & Fabrication

The fabrication team utilizes part drawings and industrial machinery like mills, lathes, and routers to manufacture parts required for the robot.

#### Electrical

The electrical team is responsible for wiring the robot and installing any required pneumatic systems. They are tasked with ensuring that the mechanical systems, which were designed and built by the mechanical team, can be controlled effectively.

#### Programming

The programming team develops software in Java/Kotlin to control the robot's functions by integrating data from sensors such as encoders, limit switches, and vision systems. Their code ensures the robot performs effectively and safely in autonomous and teleoperated modes.

#### Business

The business team plays a critical role in managing the financial and public relations aspects of the project. They are responsible for budgeting, fundraising, and securing sponsorships to support the team's activities. They also handle social media and audiovisual tasks, as well as maintaining relationships to ensure the team’s success.

## Expectations

### Attendance Policy

Attendance is taken at every team meeting by each subteam lead. You are required to notify team
leadership about late arrivals and absences. You should contact your subteam lead by email, Discord, or Teams as
soon as possible, preferably at least 24 hours in advance. Longer absences should be communicated
earlier. These are the following criteria for attendance:

- Present
    - Being physically present is not enough—students must be attentive and productive during meeting time to be marked "present." Present markings will count positively towards your attendance percentage.
- Absent Notified & Partial Notified
    - If you know ahead of time that you will miss a meeting, your subteam lead should be informed at least 24 hours prior to the meeting. If you do so, your absence will be marked as “notified” and you will have the ability to make up for your absence. All notified absences are still counted negatively towards your attendance percentage.
- Absent Made Up & Partial Made Up 
    - For notified absences ONLY, you have the ability to make up any work from the meeting, including homework and self-studying any material covered during training. If this action is taken, the absence will be counted positively towards your attendance percentage. It is YOUR responsibility to proactively ask the subteam lead for work to make up.
- Absent Unnotified & Partial Unnotified 
    - Unnotified absences cannot be made up and will count negatively towards your attendance percentage.
- Unproductive 
    - If you are not sufficiently productive or are distracting others during a meeting, the subteam lead may mark you “unproductive.” You will be given warnings when you are marked unproductive so you know what behavior was at fault and should not be repeated. Being marked “unproductive” will count negatively towards your attendance percentage and cannot be made up.

#### Attendance Evaluations

Members must be able to attend 70% of all meetings. To track your attendance, use the rambot Discord bot on our Discord server.

Regular attendance is essential for achieving success in any team or educational setting. It enables team members to stay informed, collaborate effectively, track progress, and allocate tasks efficiently. Moreover, attendance demonstrates a commitment to the team and its objectives, which helps build trust, respect, and team cohesion.

### Monthly Member Evaluations

At the end of each month, the team roster will undergo a re-evaluation to ensure that only committed members remain on the team. Typically, students with an attendance rate below 75% will be subject to review. Those who fall below this threshold in the current month will be warned by a member of leadership, usually their subteam lead.

Apart from attendance, dismissal from the team may also be influenced by other factors. Reasons for dismissal may include, but is not limited to factors like behavior during team meetings, level of initiative, work ethic, and overall contribution to the team environment.

Subteam leads will engage with students who are not meeting the necessary requirements to stay on the team or are exhibiting behavior that puts them at risk of being dismissed. If it is determined that a student should be removed from the team, they and their parents will be informed.

### Mental Health Days
We recognize that balancing the robotics season with school, family, and other responsibilities can become stressful and wear on a student’s mental and physical health. The health of a student is always our first priority, and thus we offer members the option of Mental Health Days. When needed, every student may make use of a Mental Health Day, where they can choose to either arrive late to a meeting, leave early, or not attend. There is no defined reason to use a Mental Health Day—mounting stress, family responsibilities, and other events are all equally valid. Unless your use of mental health days become excessive, there will be no questions asked. In the case of excessive usage, the subteam lead will speak with you about their circumstances and the best way for you to proceed. You must notify your subteam lead in advance when possible and the absence will be excused
