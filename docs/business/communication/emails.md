Email is one of the primary ways people communicate on Earth. Writing a good email is crucial to ensure that your message is conveyed clearly and effectively. Here are some fundamentals on how to write a good email:

## A good subject line

The subject line is the first thing someone gets to know about your email. A good subject line can make a person really want to view your email or delete it. Having a subject line that is clear, concise and straight to the point is very important.

## The content

Don’t write really long emails. Keep your content short and sweet and to the point, and make sure you get to the main point of your message early on. 

## Grammar and spelling

Using proper grammar and spelling is important in any form of communication, and email is no exception. Make sure you proofread your email before you send it, and use tools like spell check to catch any errors. Avoid using slang or overly casual language, and aim to use a tone that is professional but approachable.

## Use a good tone

The tone of your email is important and should match the context of your message. If you're sending an email to a business, aim for a tone that is friendly and professional.  But don’t be way too professional to the point where you are wondering what you are even reading like *cough* *cough* ChatGPT. If you're sending an email to a fellow member or mentor, you can be more casual about it but still be professional and friendly.

## A good email signature

An email signature includes information about you and our team that the email receiver could find helpful for identifying and contacting us, as well as gaining insight to our team.

Here is a good example of a good signature:

```
First Last
Rambots (FRC Team 2204)
California Crosspoint Academy
Email: XXXXX@XXXXX.XXX
Website: https://rambots.org/
Address: 25500 Industrial Blvd, Hayward, CA 94545
```

## Follow Up

If you don't hear back from your recipient after a few days, it's okay to follow up with a polite email. Keep your follow-up email short and sweet, and restate your original request or question. Avoid coming across as pushy or demanding, and be patient if you don't receive a response right away.
