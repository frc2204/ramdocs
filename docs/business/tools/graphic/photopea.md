Photopea is an advanced online image editing software that allows users to edit and manipulate images in a variety of formats with a Photoshop-like interface. It's basically a free clone of Photoshop that runs entirely on the web (and can work offline). Use this with [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/#readme).
