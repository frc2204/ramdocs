For our newsletter, we use the service [MailerLite](https://www.mailerlite.com/). MailerLite is a service we use to send out newsleters to everyone in our mailing list including sponsors and parents. MailerLite also has a drag-and-drop editor that allows us to make nice looking newsletters (like the one shown above). We also post a public copy of our newsletter to our website (in Markdown).

We typically try to post a newsletter every week. However, if not much is done in that week, we can write a newsletter combining two (or even more) weeks. For competitions, we try to post a update newsletter every day.
