Electrical safety is very important because if you are not careful you could shock yourself which may cause mild harm or burns. To avoid getting shocked when working with electrical systems, always make sure that the system is turned off and the battery is unplugged. When the system is turned on, avoid any open wires and if there are any turn off the system and cover the wires because there should not be any exposed wires. Do not cut any live wires or do anything electrical while the robot is on. Do not connect the battery to itself as that would cause the battery to explode. In case someone heart stops due to an electric shock, call 911, preform chest compressions on that person and have someone get and use the AED (located near the central staircase).
