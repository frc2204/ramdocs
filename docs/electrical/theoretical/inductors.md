An inductor is an electromagnet. It is a coil of wire that creates a magnetic field when current start to flow through the wire. The coil can store energy and when the circuit is open current continues to flow from until the magnetic field collapses. It also opposes any change in the amount of current that flows through it. The capacity of the inductor is determined by the number of coils, the material that the coils are wrapped around, the cross-sectional are of the core, and the length of the coil.
