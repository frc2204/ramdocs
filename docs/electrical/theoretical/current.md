Current is the rate at which electrons flow through a pint in an electrical circuit. In simplest terms, current = flow. The unit for current is an ampere or amp. 1 amp means that 1 coulomb of electrons (6.24 x 10^18 electrons) are moving past a single point in the circuit in 1 second. There are two types of current, direct current (dc) and alternating current (ac). Direct current only flows in one direction and is used in batteries or a dc generator. Alternating current flows in a sine wave pattern meaning that it reverses direction at regular intervals. AC current is used in household electronics powered by a wall outlet. Current can be measured using a multimeter.![image](https://github.com/frc2204/ramdocs/assets/132165007/a16e79b5-d1a0-471b-a1c6-b369e88867dc)
