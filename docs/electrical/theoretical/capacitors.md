A capacitor is like a battery as they both hold and store electrical energy, but they work in different ways. Inside a capacitor the terminals connect two metal plates separated by a non-conducting material, or dielectric. The dielectric affects the type of capacitor and its function. The capacitors storage potential is measure in farads. A 1-farand capacitor can store 1 coulomb and can hold 1 amp-second of electrons at 1 volt.
