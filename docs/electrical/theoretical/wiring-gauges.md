Wire gages refers to the wires thickness. The thickness is measure by the American Wire Gauge, or AWG and the higher the number, the thinner the wire. So, a wire with 10 AWG will be thicker than a wire with 22 AWG and a wire with 1 AWG will be thicker than a wire with 10 AWG. The thickness determines how much current can safely go through the wire, The more amperage the device needs, the thicker the wire will be. ![image](https://github.com/frc2204/ramdocs/assets/132165007/497c08f8-179e-4c68-baac-a195c9b8622a)
